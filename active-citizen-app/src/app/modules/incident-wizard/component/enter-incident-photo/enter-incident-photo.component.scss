If you're applying styles to your containerDivClass from a component stylesheet, rather than
from a global stylesheet, then apply the ::ng-deep combinator in order to apply
your styles within the modal-window component.  The shadow-piercing operators
were recently removed without replacement in the evolving W3C spec.  This is an
evolving topic and ng-deep is Angular's answer to this for the time being, although
it's marked as deprecated and thus should be considered a temporary solution.
I would suggest using this with caution in case the Angular team removes ng-deep
before a clear replacement comes around.  See:
